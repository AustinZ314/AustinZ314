<h3>ðŸ‘‹ Hello!</h3>

Hi, Iâ€™m Austin! I am a Computer Science and Linguistics major at Rutgers University - New Brunswick. I'm very interested in natural language processing, but I enjoy learning new skills and exploring other areas of computing as well. I also love learning new languages (both programming languages and foreign languages)!

- ðŸ“š I'm currently working on finishing school and tutoring other computer science students.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the MERN stack and some SQL database management systems.
- ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on various projects to build my portfolio, learn new tech skills, and improve my university community.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email me at [austinszhang1@gmail.com](url)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/his
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am trilingual and I am working on learning a fourth language.
